# UFOs
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to compile UFO sighting data onto a website where users can search sighting data based on their selected variables.

## Results
The created webpage allows users to parse through the date using different search/filter options. Users can filter by date, city, state, country, or shape. Searching a criteria in each section will show the total sightings based on that criteria. You can specifiy further by selecting multiple criteria to search by. For example, searching 1/13/2010 in the date section will yeild 3 UFO sightings that occured that day.

## Summary
### Drawbacks
The page doesn't allow users to search a range of dates or multiple areas at once. It would be tedious to have to search each individual date or each area at a time.
### Recommendations
Add more filter options, such as time of day.
Add pagination to improve user experience.
